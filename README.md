You are asked to implement a similar game in its most complete form.
It is a windowed windows forms application for which the following applies
requirements/assumptions:
i. The game will have a specific duration.
ii. top 10 scores will be recorded and kept even after the application is closed.
iii. The player will have a spaceship which can move right, left, up
and down.
iv. The spaceship will be able to fire shells by pressing a button (e.g. Space). The shells
will move in a straight line from the point where they were fired.
v. At the other end of the screen will be the "opponent". The opponent will be firing enemy fire towards
the user's spacecraft. The opponent will move on the horizontal axis randomly.
vi. Each opponent's shell hit will add score to the user. Each hit of the
spacecraft by an opponent's shell will either reduce the score or eat a "life"
(you decide which implementation you want to do).
vii. I suggest using menus in your game.
viii. You are free to "enrich" the implementation with additional additions of your own, as long as you
they make sense and do not contradict what is written in this pronouncement
